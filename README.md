How It Works :

1. **HTML** provides the structure: headings, input box, and an empty list for tasks.
2. **CSS** styles the page to make it look nice.
3. **JavaScript** adds interactivity:
   - Shows initial tasks.
   - Lets you add new tasks.
   - Lets you mark tasks as completed by clicking the checkbox.
   - Lets you delete tasks by clicking the trash icon.

The combination of these three elements (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) creates a functional and visually appealing todo list application.
